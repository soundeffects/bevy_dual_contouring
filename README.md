# bevy_dual_contouring
This library implements [Manifold Dual Contouring](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/schaefer/research/dualsimp_tvcg.pdf) to create a mesh in the Bevy engine from regular samples of voxel data (chunks).

Currently the project is a work-in-progress, and unusable.

## Credits
@hmeyer on GitHub created the tesselation library, which this library forks. Credit to him on the initial implementation of the dual contouring algorithm.
